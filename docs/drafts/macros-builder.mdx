# Macros Builder

If you are looking to perform batch calls to the Superfluid Protocol,
you can use the Macros Builder to create and manage your own custom macros.
To learn more about Macros and how to use them, refer to the [Macros](/docs/sdk/advanced-topics/batch-macros) section.

:::warning Be mindful!
The Macros Builder is a highly experimental and new tool.
When using it to generate your smart contract, please be cautious and test your smart contract thoroughly.
This tool is made to help you understand how to create your own macros not to provide a ready-to-deploy solution.

THE MACROS BUILDER ARE NOT YET AUDITED.
